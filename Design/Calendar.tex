\section{Introduction}

This program set are programs to display and printout a calendar of events for the user.  It should be able to display a number of different calendars both real and fictional.  
The python verion is intended to have a number of different UIs which the C version is primarily a command line interface and the Fortran version for use in programs.  I've 
written bits and pieces in various computing languages over the decades and have lost some versions so this is an attempt to get it all together, written and working on the 
linux platform.  Another hope is to do it well enough in python to make it portable to other platforms.  Porting to other operating systems is low priority for me but may be
done as an exercise.

Different calendars desired
     \bi
     \item Gregorian
     \item Julian
     \item Shire
     \item oriental
     \item Jewish
     \item Scientific
     \item perpetual
     \item Mars 
     \item lunar
     \item Various other proposed calendar ideas
     \ei
     
User Interfaces for the program set; Graphical, Web Browser and Command Line.  Depending on the user interface not all features may be available.  Below is a listing of various
program features and subfeatures;

\bi     
\item printout a calendar
     \bi
     \item Day's events
     \item by week
     \item by month
     \item by year
     \item blank calendar (month, year)
     \item for calendars week long or greater give an option as to which is the starting day of the week
     \ei
\item convert between calendars
\item account for time zones based on location
\item schedule an event
\item be able to invite other people by e-mail-ics-gcal
\item be able to import events from iCal and other calendars
\item printout or email day's events to user using preferred calendar structure or random calendar
\item support multiple calendars for each user
\ei

\section{Calendar Information}
\subsection{Gregorian}
	365 days per year except leap year has 366.  Has 12 months with 28, 29, 30 or 31 days.  Months are;
	January(31 Days), February(28,29 days), March(31 days), April(30 days), May(31 days), June(30 days), July(31 days), 
	August(31 days), September(30 days), October(31 days), November(30 days), and December(31 days).
		Converted from Julian calendar on 10/15/1582 Julian becoming 10/15/1582 Gregorian in some locations.
\subsection{Julian}
		365 days per year with 12 months with 28, 29, 30 or 31 days.  Months are;
	January(31 Days), February(28 days), March(31 days), April(30 days), May(31 days), June(30 days), July(31 days), 
	August(31 days), September(30 days), October(31 days), November(30 days), and December(31 days).
		Converted from Julian calendar on 10/15/1582 Julian becoming 10/15/1582 Gregorian in some locations.
 \subsection{Shire}
The Shire calendar found in J.R.Tolkein Ring series has twelve months of thirty
days with four days not in a month and one or two not in a month or week.  Each
year starts on 2Yule which is Sterrendei (equivalent to Saturday).  The year
pattern is 2Yule, 1-30 Afteryule, 1-30 Solmath, 1-30 Rethe, 1-30 Astron, 1-30
Thrimidge, 1-30 Forelithe, 1Lithe, [Midyear's Day, (Overlithe)], 2Lithe, 1-30
Afterlithe, 1-30 Wedmath, 1-30 Halimath, 1-30 Winterfilth, 1-30 Blotmath, 
1-30 Foreyule, 1Yule.  Overlithe added for leap years and Midyear's Day are not
part of any week.

Days of the week are; Sterrendei, Sunnendei, Momendei, Trewesdei,Hevenesdei,
Meresdei, and Highdei. 
\subsection{Oriental}
Chinese Zodiac animals - monkey, rooster, dog, pig, rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep 
\subsection{Jewish}

\bi
	\item A month is calculated as 29 days, 12 hours, and 793 "parts"
	\item Leap years occur in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 19 of a 19-year cycle
	\item Adjustments (dechiyot) prevent round off the date calculated
	\item Dechiyot prevent oddities in the length of the year
	\item  Dechiyot prevent holidays from falling on the wrong day of the week
	\item  Some months have variable lengths
	\item There are 14 possible formats of year, identified by codes
	\item  The calendar is not perfect, but it is very accurate
\ei
\subsection{Scientific / International fixed}
13 months of 28 days which starts on Sunday, \\
midDay is between the 14th and 15th of the seventh month as well as LeapDay both of which are not part of the week
\subsection{perpetual?}
This calendar was proposed a while ago and I don't remember all the details.
It has thirteen months of twenty eight days with MidDay between the fouteenth and
fifteenth day of the seventh month.  MidDay and LeapDay which is added on leap
years are not part of the week similar to the Shire Calendar.
\subsection{Mars}
MDay=24hrs,39min 35 seconds  Myear is 668.82 MDays = 687 EDays
\subsection{Earth Lunar}
