A few years ago, I was in a <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/synagogue.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">synagogue</a>, and I 
overheard one man ask another, "When is 
<a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/chanukkah.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Chanukkah</a> this year?" The other man smiled 
slyly and replied, "Same as always: the 25th of Kislev." This humorous comment 
makes an important point: the date of <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/holidays.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Jewish 
holidays</a> does not change from year to year. Holidays are celebrated on the 
same day of the Jewish calendar every year, but the Jewish year is not the same 
length as a solar year on the civil calendar used by most of the western world, 
so the date shifts on the civil calendar. 
</p>
<h3 id="History">Background and History</h3>
<p>
The Jewish calendar is based on three astronomical phenomena: the rotation of 
the Earth about its axis (a day); the revolution of the moon about the Earth (a 
month); and the revolution of the Earth about the sun (a year). These three 
phenomena are independent of each other, so there is no direct correlation 
between them. On average, the moon revolves around the Earth in about 29½ 
days. The Earth revolves around the sun in about 365¼ days, that is, about 
12.4 lunar months. 
</p>
<p>
The civil calendar used by most of the world has abandoned any correlation 
between the moon cycles and the month, arbitrarily setting the length of months 
to 28, 30 or 31 days. 
</p>
<p>
The Jewish calendar, however, coordinates all three of these astronomical 
phenomena. Months are either 29 or 30 days, corresponding to the 29½-day 
lunar cycle. Years are either 12 or 13 months, corresponding to the 12.4 month 
solar cycle. 
</p>
<p>
The lunar month on the Jewish calendar begins when the first sliver of moon 
becomes visible after the dark of the moon. In ancient times, the new months 
used to be determined by observation. When people observed the new moon, they 
would notify the Sanhedrin. When the Sanhedrin heard testimony from two 
independent, reliable eyewitnesses that the new moon occurred on a certain 
date, they would declare the <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/chodesh.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">rosh chodesh</a> (first 
of the month) and send out messengers to tell people when the month began. 
</p>
<p>
The problem with strictly lunar calendars is that there are approximately 12.4 
lunar months in every solar year, so a 12-month lunar calendar is about 11 days 
shorter than a solar year and a 13-month lunar is about 19 longer than a solar 
year. The months drift around the seasons on such a calendar: on a 12-month 
lunar calendar, the month of Nissan, which is supposed to occur in the Spring, 
would occur 11 days earlier in the season each year, eventually occurring in 
the Winter, the Fall, the Summer, and then the Spring again. On a 13-month 
lunar calendar, the same thing would happen in the other direction, and faster. 
</p>
<p>
To compensate for this drift, the Jewish calendar uses a 12-month lunar 
calendar with an extra month occasionally added. The month of Nissan occurs 11 
days earlier each year for two or three years, and then jumps forward 30 days, 
balancing out the drift. In ancient times, this month was added by observation: 
the Sanhedrin observed the conditions of the weather, the crops and the 
livestock, and if these were not sufficiently advanced to be considered 
"spring," then the Sanhedrin inserted an additional month into the calendar to 
make sure that Pesach (Passover) would occur in the spring (it is, after all, 
referred to in the Torah as Chag he-Aviv, the Festival of Spring!). 
</p>
<p>
A year with 13 months is referred to in Hebrew as Shanah Me'uberet (pronounced 
shah-NAH meh-oo-BEH-reht), literally: a pregnant year. In English, we commonly 
call it a leap year. The additional month is known as Adar I, Adar Rishon 
(first Adar) or Adar Alef (the <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/alephbet.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Hebrew letter</a> 
Alef being the numeral "1" in Hebrew). The extra month is inserted before the 
regular month of Adar (known in such years as Adar II, Adar Sheini or Adar 
Beit). Note that Adar II is the "real" Adar, the one in which 
<a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/purim.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Purim</a> is celebrated, the one in which 
<a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/yahrzeit.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">yahrzeits</a> for Adar are observed, the one in 
which a 13-year-old born in Adar becomes a <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/barmitz.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Bar 
Mitzvah</a>. Adar I is the "extra" Adar. 
</p>
<p>
In the fourth century, Hillel II established a fixed calendar based on 
mathematical and astronomical calculations. This calendar, still in use, 
standardized the length of months and the addition of months over the course of 
a 19 year cycle, so that the lunar calendar realigns with the solar years. Adar 
I is added in the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th and 19th years of the cycle. 
The current cycle began in Jewish year 5758 (the year that began October 2, 
1997). If you are musically inclined, you may find it helpful to remember this 
pattern of leap years by reference to the major scale: for each whole step 
there are two regular years and a leap year; for each half-step there is one 
regular year and a leap year. This is easier to understand when you examine the 
keyboard illustration below and see how it relates to the leap years above.

<p>
In addition, <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/yomkippur.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Yom Kippur</a> should not fall 
adjacent to <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/shabbat.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Shabbat</a>, because this would cause 
difficulties in coordinating the fast with Shabbat, and 
<a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/hoshanah.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Hoshanah Rabbah</a> should not fall on Saturday 
because it would interfere with the holiday's observances. A day is added to 
the month of Cheshvan or subtracted from the month of Kislev of the previous 
year to prevent these things from happening. This process is sometimes referred 
to as "fixing" Rosh Hashanah. If you are interested in the details of how these 
calculations are performed, see <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/calendr2.htm">The Jewish Calendar: A 
Closer Look</a>. 
</p>
<h3 id="Years">Numbering of Jewish Years</h3>
<p>
The year number on the Jewish calendar represents the number of years since 
creation, calculated by adding up the ages of people in the Bible back to the 
time of creation. However, this does not necessarily mean that the universe has 
existed for only 5700 years as we understand years. Many 
<a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/orthodox.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Orthodox</a> Jews will readily acknowledge that the 
first six "days" of creation are not necessarily 24-hour days (indeed, a 
24-hour day would be meaningless until the creation of the sun on the fourth 
"day"). For a fascinating (albeit somewhat defensive) article by a nuclear 
physicist showing how Einstein's Theory of Relativity sheds light on the 
correspondence between the <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/torah.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Torah</a>'s age of the 
universe and the age ascertained by science, see 
<a href="http://www.aish.com/ci/sam/48951136.html">The Age of the Universe</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Jews do not generally use the words "A.D." and "B.C." to refer to the years on 
the civil calendar. "A.D." means "the year of our L-rd," and we do not believe 
Jesus is the L-rd. Instead, we use the abbreviations C.E. (Common or Christian 
Era) and B.C.E. (Before the Common Era), which are commonly used by scholars 
today. 
</p>
<h3 id="Months">Months of the Jewish Year</h3>
<p>
The "first month" of the Jewish calendar is the month of Nissan, in the spring, 
when <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/passover.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Passover</a> occurs. However, the 
<a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/rosh.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Jewish New Year</a> is in Tishri, the seventh month, 
and that is when the year number is increased. This concept of different 
starting points for a year is not as strange as it might seem at first glance. 
The American "new year" starts in January, but the new "school year" starts in 
September, and many businesses have "fiscal years" that start at various times 
of the year. Similarly, the Jewish calendar has different starting points for 
different purposes. 
</p>
<p>
The names of the months of the Jewish calendar were adopted during the time of 
Ezra, after the return from the Babylonian exile. The names are actually 
Babylonian month names, brought back to Israel by the returning exiles. Note 
that most of the Bible refers to months by number, not by name. 
</p>
<p>
The Jewish calendar has the following months:

<p>
The length of Cheshvan and Kislev are determined by complex calculations 
involving the time of day of the full moon of the following year's Tishri and 
the day of the week that Tishri would occur in the following year. After many 
years of blissful ignorance, I finally sat down and worked out the mathematics 
involved, and I have added a page on <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/calendr2.htm">The Jewish 
Calendar: A Closer Look</a>, which may be of interest to those who want a 
deeper understanding or who want to write a Jewish calendar computer program. 
For the rest of us, there are plenty of easily accessible computer programs 
that will calculate the Jewish calendar for more than a millennium to come. I 
have provided some links <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/calendar.htm#Links">below</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Note that the number of days between Nissan and Tishri is always the same. 
Because of this, the time from the first major festival 
(<a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/passover.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Passover</a> in Nissan) to the last major festival 
(<a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/sukkot.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Sukkot</a> in Tishri) is always the same. 
</p>
<h3 id="Weekdays">Days of the Jewish Week</h3>
<p>
Other than <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/shabbat.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Shabbat</a>, the name of the seventh day 
of the week, the Jewish calendar doesn't have names for the days of the week. 
The days of the week are simply known as first day, second day, third day, etc. 
Sometimes they are referred to more fully as First Day of the Sabbath, etc. 
Below is a list for those who are interested.

I maintain a <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/current.shtml">current Jewish calendar</a> on this 
website. Unlike most Jewish calendars you will see, my calendar shows the 
Hebrew months with the corresponding civil dates. 
</p>
<p>
Most printed Jewish calendars cover a 16-month period: from September of one 
year (to include <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/rosh.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Rosh Hashanah</a>) to December of the 
following year. Be aware, however, that some show only the 12-month period from 
September to August, and some that claim to have the full 16-month period show 
only limited information about September to December of the latter year. They 
show the civil months with Jewish <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/holidays.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">holidays</a>, 
<a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/readings.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">Torah readings</a>, candle-lighting times and so 
forth. I am particularly partial to the London Jewish Museum calendar, which 
has illustrations of Jewish artwork from the middle ages to the 1800s, but 
there are many Jewish calendars available on 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=jewish%20calendar&amp;linkcode=ur2&amp;tag=judaism101&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">Amazon.com</a>.

If you would like to look up the date of a Jewish holiday, from the Gregorian 
(civil) year 1 to the Gregorian year 9999, try 
<a href="http://www.hebcal.com/">http://www.hebcal.com</a>. I don't know how 
accurate this is (especially given that during the earlier dates, months were 
determined by observation), but I haven't caught any mistakes in it yet. Of 
course, the earlier Gregorian dates are artificial, since the Gregorian 
calendar did not exist until the 16th century and was not accepted in many 
parts of the world until much later (they used the less accurate Julian 
calendar). There is also a very nice, quick and easy converter to and from 
Hebrew dates on 
<a href="http://www.chabad.org/calendar/1000year_cdo/aid/6225/jewish/Date-Converter.htm">Chabad's 
website</a>.

If you would like to make your own computerized Jewish calendar, my page on 
<a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/calendr2.htm">The Jewish Calendar: A Closer Look</a> explains in 
detail how the calendar works and provides illustrative JavaScript code.
