# python-EdsCal
A normal Gregorian calendar of events but with many different calendars also for use  

While using the normal Gregorian calendar for events I wish to be able to add other calendars for display and use such as, the Jewish calendar, Julian Calendar, the Japanese variant of the oriental calendar along with fictional ones like Stardate, the Shire calendar for Tolkein and others.

The main language in use is to be python since I'm trying to learn that I may include Modern Fortran and C pieces to learn how to do that also
